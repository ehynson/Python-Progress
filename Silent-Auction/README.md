# Silent Auction Project

This is a console-based silent auction program built in Python as part of my learning journey.

## Features

- Users can enter their name and bid anonymously.
- Supports multiple bidders through a loop.
- Automatically determines the highest bidder at the end.
- Clears the screen between bidders to keep bids private (via a simple newline trick).

## How It Works

1. The program starts by prompting the first bidder for their name and bid.
2. It then asks if there are any other bidders.
3. If more bidders exist, it collects their info and "clears" the screen.
4. Once bidding is closed, it calculates and displays the winner with the highest bid.

## What I Learned

- Using dictionaries to store and manage user input.
- Controlling program flow with `while` loops and conditionals.
- Simple screen-clearing techniques for a cleaner user experience.
- Finding the highest value from user-submitted data.

This project was written entirely using beginner-friendly concepts—no functions or classes—keeping things simple while reinforcing the core logic behind loops, conditionals, and dictionaries.
