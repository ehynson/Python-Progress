# Python Learning Projects

This repository documents my progress as I learn Python. Each project is designed to build my understanding of programming fundamentals and demonstrate what Iâ€™ve learned so far. These projects are beginner-focused and aim to reflect clean, functional, and logically structured code.

## Completed Projects

### `hangman-project/`
A multi-file Hangman game built using loops, conditionals, and string operations. This project was my first time working with multiple modules (`main.py`, `hangman_art.py`, and `hangman_words.py`), making use of ASCII art and a game loop to create a complete user experience. It demonstrates user input validation, basic game logic, and how to organize code across files.

### `password-generator/`
This simple password generator asks the user how many letters, numbers, and symbols they would like in their password and then creates a randomized password that matches those preferences. The program introduces the use of lists, loops, user input, and the `random` module to achieve its functionality. It serves as a foundation for understanding how to dynamically build and manipulate data based on user-defined parameters.

## Topics Covered So Far

- Variables and data types
- Input and output
- Conditional logic
- Loops and iteration
- Lists and string operations
- Randomization using the `random` module
- Code organization using modules
- Basic debugging and error handling

## Roadmap

In upcoming projects, I will be working with:
- Functions and reusability
- More modular code structure
- Intermediate problem solving
- Expanding program complexity

This repository will continue to grow as I build more projects and explore new concepts in Python.
