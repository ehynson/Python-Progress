# Caesar Cipher

A beginner-friendly Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique.  
This classic cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## Features

- Encrypt messages using a user-defined shift value  
- Decrypt messages using the reverse shift  
- Preserves spaces and punctuation  
- Handles wrap-around (e.g., shifting 'z' forward becomes 'a')

---

## How to Use

1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Choose an operation:  
   - Type `encode` to encrypt  
   - Type `decode` to decrypt
3. Enter your message.
4. Provide a shift number (integer).
5. View the result printed in the console.
